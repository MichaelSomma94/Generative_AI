But getting Huggingface set up on one is an absolute nightmare. All the ‘Quick’, ‘Easy’, ‘Simple’ tutorials innevitably fail to capture the smaller details required in order to succesfully get Huggingface installed and working on your Apple Silicon machine. I hope to help alleviate a big chunk of those problems.I created an entire video in which I install Huggingface Transformers and all its dependencies on my own 16 inch M1 Pro machine using the instructions specified here. I explain these steps in a lot more detail in the video so if you find that helpful/necessary or are simply curious, feel free to check it out.\"\n",
